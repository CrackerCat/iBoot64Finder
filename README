IV. Notes
	> iOS 14 support will be added once the first non-beta will be released by Apple,
	> I advise to use this shitty tool for the lastest versions (iOS 7.1.2 | 13.6 | ...),
	> bof64 is buggy so I had to remove many functions... (like _strsep, _panic, +14 others),
	> This project was made for programming skills and knowledges improvement with bootloaders,
	> More functions will be added so this repo will be regulary updated! (PullRequest are welcome).
